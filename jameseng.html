      <h2>NEW EYES OF HUMANITY</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        The James Webb Telescope has finally been launched. A giant step for
        humanity. <br /><br />
        It is certain that we will see much farther and much higher quality
        images in the universe than Hubble. It is not known what discoveries
        will be made. But in a universe where the nearest and farthest stars are
        not different from each other, it is very difficult to think that the
        end of the universe will be seen, extraterrestrial life forms and
        intelligent creatures will be discovered. <br /><br />
        The most important feature is that it looks at the universe in infrared,
        not optical like Hubble. If we look at the universe with our eyes, of
        course, we only look, but we cannot see. You know, looking and seeing
        are very different things. When we look, we cannot see any physical
        force. We cannot see gravitational waves or black holes directly. So the
        James Webb telescope will provide us with very valuable information.

      <h2>FOR EXAMPLE</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        I think one of the biggest discoveries of the telescope, maybe one of
        the first discoveries, will be to learn that the age of the universe is
        even older, even bigger. Instead of being able to see farther, doing the
        research of seeing the unseen nearby will help to find the answers to
        the curious questions.

        Universe. The greatest magnitude that human beings can comprehend. It is
        selfish to think that such an enormous size exists only for humans and
        that only earthly creatures live. So where are these creatures? Maybe
        we’re searching in the wrong place, wrong shape or size. Yes, in all the
        cells of the universe, in its most remote points, there is tremendous
        physical life on both the macro and quantum scales. Every second
        satellites, planets, black holes … etc. they are not stationary and
        there is excellent mobility.

      <br /><br />
      <h2>HOW ABOUT LIFE ON EARTH?</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Is there anything similar to this worldly life in the universe? Must be.
        The perfect size of the universe cannot be superfluous. We human beings
        see or perceive in 4 dimensions. What if they live in other dimensions?
        Maybe we’re together. Maybe we even contact them without realizing it.
        We may be search for extraterrestrial intelligent life forms in the
        wrong dimensions and places, using the wrong methods.

      <p>
        Why do we humans imagine extraterrestrials as gifted, or typically green
        Martian? If the body of the living species on a planet with 70% surface
        water consists of 70% water, other planets do not need to be in this
        proportion or form. There may be living or intelligent life forms that
        evolve according to the physical structures of their own world. If the
        geological features of the planets, for example, consist of ice, sand or
        metal, the living things of these places may also be composed of these
        materials. <br /><br />
        After all, didn’t life on earth also start from organic minerals? It may
        not even be just material. There may even be creatures made of energy or
        light that can travel at the speed of light, traveling through the
        universe without the need for any respiratory system. Moreover, these
        creatures can be in different sizes from ours, even in the same places
        as us. In nested universes such as the Venn diagram, their lives overlap
        with us, they may be in contact with some of us. If we can provide the
        necessary conditions, we can also contact and exchange cultures with
        these living forms.

      <h2>CREATURES ON EARTH</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Different creatures on earth see the world in different colors and
        shapes. Different smells, different colors, different frequency sounds,
        etc. as. We need to examine and solve the physiological or especially
        the sense organs of living things. Because we can see many things that
        these creatures can see but that we cannot. <br /><br />
        The universe has an enormous size, but it has just as much simplicity.
        By looking at the diversity of plants, animals and humans in our world
        and their physiological characteristics, we can solve many mysteries of
        the universe.
