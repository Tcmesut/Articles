      <h1>MARS</h1>

      <h2>OUR WORLDâ€™S BROTHER</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Mars is, so to speak, the brother of our world who lives far from home.
        It is as if human beings, just like the world, always want to meet him,
        as if they missed this brother. One day weâ€™ll meet, but we donâ€™t know
        whoâ€™s going to get lucky. For now, we are trying to get to know this
        brother from afar, but as the years progress, we will get to know him
        more closely. <br /><br />
        There are still many unsolved mysteries about this planet, of which we
        are becoming more and more aware with the probes we send into or on its
        orbit. We no longer expect to see a green-colored Martian on it, but we
        continue to explore it with curiosity, hoping to find remnants of
        civilization or underground life forms. <br /><br />
        One of our biggest projects on Mars is to establish colonies suitable
        for human habitation here in the future. We must achieve this because we
        need to scatter across the universe against global catastrophes in order
        to continue our race. <br /><br />
        Of course itâ€™s not that easy. There is no magnetic field, atmosphere,
        suitable climatic conditions, and most importantly, the continuity of
        the food chain necessary for life. The need for food, water and air must
        be safely circulated. A continuous loop cannot be achieved by transport
        from Earth or surrounding satellites. <br /><br />
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>AND THESE DON'T EXIST?</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Sure there are some, but not like in the world. There is atmosphere but
        very little. Atmospheric pressure is about 6 percent of the earthâ€™s
        atmosphere. The ices detected are also carbon dioxide ice. But it is
        thought that there is water underground. These estimates are based on a
        lot of measurement and observation, for more than one reason.
        <br /><br />
        The most exciting ones are the abrasions resembling the water erosion
        seen in the resulting images, especially in the corrugated valleys.
        These erosions strengthen the possibility that there may be water on
        Martian soil. Of course, scientific institutions have made various
        statements from time to time about the factors that cause this erosion.
        However, considering that it has not been mentioned before, other
        possible causes are as follows.

      <br />
      <h2>CAUSE OF CORRUGATED VALLEYS ON MARS</h2>
      <br /><br />

      <br /><br />
      <p>
        In addition to the theories about the cause of the grooves in the
        craters on the Martian surface, the following theories can be added.
        <br /><br />
        1- Watery craters formed by the impact of icy meteorites on the surface
        of Mars. The water, which has become liquid due to the impact of the
        impact, can be formed by flowing into the formed crater. The ice
        scattered around as a result of the impact may melt and cause a
        deformation on the surface. <br /><br />
        2- The fact that the Martian soil is relatively thin can cause water to
        flow like water, especially in hollow areas such as craters. Sands
        displaced by Martian winds can wear out on the surface just as water
        flows into valleys and craters. <br /><br />
        3- Calcium perchlorate. This type of soil found on Mars absorbs the
        moist air in the atmosphere and becomes muddy. The moisture trapped out
        of the crater by the pressure created by the meteor collision returns to
        the crater formed as a result of the collision, causing erosion like
        liquid leakage. <br /><br />
        Of course, these may not make sense enough, they may have been mentioned
        before, but I think that writing here may be useful in the future. Hope
        to meet our brother one day and live together ðŸ˜Š
