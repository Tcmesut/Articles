        Covid 19. and Micro Aliens <br /><br />
        It is a disease that no one knew about its existence until 2 years ago,
        causing panic all over the world with the effect of mass media and
        social media and causing social and economic destruction at the global
        level. <br /><br />
        In fact, more dangerous diseases have killed more people in history, but
        none have caused so much fear, panic and economic destruction. There are
        many reasons for this fear and panic. However, especially the fact that
        the disease is seen intensely in developed countries, rich and popular
        people instead of poor and underdeveloped countries, and the mass media
        are widespread all over the world, caused an effective fear at the
        global level, industrial establishments, food and logistics networks
        that stopped their production as a result of the quarantine measures
        applied. created serious difficulties in large companies and
        organizations such as retail industries, etc. The supply and demand
        problems experienced led to global socio-economic crises. <br /><br />
        Even more worrying was the vulnerability of mankind to this disease,
        which has suddenly become a global threat, especially in the field of
        medicine. In the face of the spread of the disease, the lack of any
        vaccine or medicine, the rapid increase in the number of diseases and
        deaths caused fear and panic in societies, and there were strict social
        life restrictions at the global level. <br /><br />
        Although the social shock experienced in the early days has been
        overcome, its effects seem to continue in the long term. In the
        globalizing world, the whole world watched moment by moment how the
        whole world was destroyed not only by wars but also by invisible
        enemies. <br /><br />
        It has been seen by everyone how science and technology are insufficient
        in the face of creatures too small to be seen with the naked eye. It
        looks like it will stay after that, because almost every year, in
        addition to the existing ones, similar infectious diseases appear. Many
        are under control or neutralized in a short time without causing much
        destruction. Because in general, their structure, symptoms and
        transmission methods are known or can be predicted. But what if an
        unknown enemy shows up? What about hidden and unseen enemies that
        science has never known, seen, heard or even known about before, and may
        even come to our world from outer space? It will sound a bit off, but
        instinctive predators like the creature in Alien can come as small eggs
        and pose a serious global threat. Such creatures can come in the form of
        eggs, spores or pollen through meteorites and multiply rapidly.
        <br /><br />
        Yeah. You did not hear wrong. From outer space. Ladies and gentlemen.
        Here is our new character: Micro Aliens!

      <h2>MICRO ALIENS?</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        We expect the danger from outer space, in general, from high-tech aliens
        and colliding meteorites. However, after the last covid19 pandemic, we
        have seen that we need to be on our guard against dangerous germs,
        viruses and bacteria that may come with meteorites. If we can send
        microbes with the probes we send to space, our world can be infected
        with diseases that may be a global threat after coming from space, by
        air or wind. <br /><br />
        Don’t say it’s impossible. It could be. After all, didn’t life on earth
        come from outer space? While there are many creatures that can live at
        high temperatures and low temperatures even in our world, living things
        that have evolved according to the conditions of their own planets,
        especially at the level of microorganisms, can come to our world and
        multiply rapidly in ideal living conditions here and pose a global
        threat. <br /><br />
        If the ancestors of today’s living things came to our planet from
        elsewhere in the universe and started life many years ago, this is
        likely to happen again. It’s happened before, it could probably happen
        again. <br /><br />
        Life can exist anywhere in the universe. It doesn’t have to be an
        advanced civilization. extraterrestrials may not come here. But they may
        also have germs, viruses or various kinds of infectious diseases.
        Although living things themselves cannot come, microorganisms that are
        thrown into space by close earth-body collisions, the severe gravity of
        mutual satellites or severe storms under low gravity can easily
        reproduce in suitable climate conditions on the satellites or planets
        they can reach. Of course, the most suitable climate conditions that we
        know in the universe exist in our world. <br /><br />
        When we look at the living things in the world, especially humans and
        animals breathe through the lungs or trachea, which is suitable for the
        living conditions of our planet. They can live between certain
        temperature values, which are not very flexible. But smaller, bacterial
        microorganisms can survive in harsher climatic conditions at lower or
        higher temperatures. Therefore, it seems possible that such creatures,
        which have evolved to be even more durable in harsh space conditions,
        especially in the climate of their own planets, will survive and travel
        to planets or interstellar space without serious damage. <br /><br />
        For now, these predictions don’t make much sense, but even if there is a
        very small probability, yes, they can happen. It’s happened in the past.
        Why not again?
