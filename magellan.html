        Is there life other than us in the universe? This question is one of the
        most curious questions of mankind throughout history. Especially in the
        last century, with the increasing scientific developments, more
        intensive researches have started to search for the answer to this
        question. Billions of dollars are being made to find this answer, and
        these investments seem to continue in the future. <br /><br />
        It is not known whether we can find the answer we are looking for in
        these studies. Even if we find it, can we go there in the vast expanse
        of the universe? Even if we can’t go, can we have a dialogue with the
        life forms there? We will see this together in the future.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>
        WHILE LOOKING FOR THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION. CAN WE ASK OURSELVES THE
        FOLLOWING QUESTION ?
      </h2>

          >“I wonder if we can establish a life environment on other planets?” </i
        >Why not? <br /><br />
        We will eventually even send humans to other planets, while we are
        careful not to send germs even with probes yet. What about the places we
        can’t set foot? If we take ourselves along with our microbes, we can
        take the species we want to space travel in the quantities we want.
        <br /><br />
        The plants and animals we send to a planet or satellite that we think
        may be suitable for life will evolve according to the environment they
        are in, and will try to adapt the environment and create its habitat.
        Although this process will take many years, a sustainable life will
        emerge at the middle point. Isn’t that how life on earth came about
        anyway? <br /><br />
        All living things on earth can only live in the climatic conditions of
        this planet. All atmospheric features seem to have been specially
        designed for living things on the planet. Or, living things have adapted
        to these atmospheric conditions. <br />
        <br />
        What about us? Can we provide this design on other moons or planets?
        Difficult but not impossible.

      <p>
        First, we need to find a celestial body that we think might be suitable
        for life. Here we can leave creatures that have previously been
        genetically modified in the laboratory environment or can live in
        difficult conditions. For example, mosses, tardigrades. After these
        creatures start respiration and photosynthesis in the environments they
        are left in, they will begin to release substances such as oxygen,
        carbon dioxide or methane into the environment. These substances will
        provide mutual benefits for living things to survive. While these are
        being provided, they will start to keep up with the environment
        physically. When the food chain is also provided, it means that a
        sustainable climate and habitat have emerged there. <br /><br />
        This theory can be tested experimentally in different regions of the
        earth, such as the desert, the poles, or the climatic conditions of any
        planet. <br /><br />
        It may have been thought of before. It may even have been tried. No
        information available. I believe it will be tested both on earth and on
        any planet or moon in the universe because it is easy and cost effective
        to implement. <br /><br />
        Who knows, maybe the creatures that evolved in these artificial habitats
        in the future will establish an advanced civilization millions of years
        later. Who knows?
