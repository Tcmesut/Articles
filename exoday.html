      <h1>EXODUS DAY AND NOAH’S ARKS</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>EXODUS</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Exodus. It is one of the historical turning points of the Children of
        Israel, which tells the story of their return to their promised land
        centuries ago under the leadership of the prophet Moses because of the
        famine caused by the climatic conditions.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>NOAH’S ARKS</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        The legendary ship built by the prophet Noah, which will destroy those
        who do not believe in God, will save the believers from the divine flood
        and flood, and in which all kinds of male and female animals are put in
        it. When the flood was over, the ship settled on Mount Judi, the earth
        was cleansed from the evils of people, and the climate and environment
        were restructured. <br /><br />
        In both cases, the main theme is that people make the earth
        uninhabitable, and those who want to save the world from them migrate
        elsewhere and start making new beginnings after the world is cleansed of
        the evils of the people.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>NOWADAYS</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Human population approaching 8 billion. The anarchy, terror, chaos and
        mayhem caused by so many crowds. Moreover, a World that has turned into
        an environmental disaster with the greed and ambition of human beings
        and is now on the brink of global extinction. <br /><br />
        A solution is needed. Or we will perish. Other living things will perish
        because of our own transgressions. Why? Very soon we will be like a
        Venus or Mars. Maybe one day other aliens who sent probes to Earth will
        search for the remnants of our civilization that lived and disappeared
        before.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>SO WHAT’S THE SOLUTION?</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        The simplest is that we need to protect our world from humans. If we can
        protect it from humans, Earth can easily repair the damage done to all
        plants and animals except humans. The world is like a living creature.
        She can heal wounds that bleed like living things. As long as people
        stay away. In fact, all living and non-living beings in it are like the
        organs of our world. All complement each other on the basis of mutual
        benefit. But people are selfish. She does not think of anyone but
        herself. This world does such damage that not only humans are there, but
        all living things are affected by it. <br /><br />
        And everyone’s like that? Don’t you think there’s no good people who can
        think about it? Need a divine touch like in previous times? <br /><br />
        Of course, not everyone is indifferent to this situation. Among the 8
        billion people, there are those who have noticed, warned and even taken
        action on the coming disaster. <br /><br />
        In particular, environmental organizations want to warn people about the
        impending disaster as much as they can. But people don’t care enough
        about these organizations. Some of them are worried about capital, some
        poor communities cannot pay enough attention to this disaster because of
        their livelihood.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="img-scope">
        <img src="spacex.webp" alt="" />
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Environmental organizations can only warn of the coming disaster with
        feeble actions. Unfortunately that’s all they can do. Just like the
        prophets, they warn of impending disasters, but as always, human beings
        do not listen to them. <br /><br />
        But recently, promising good things have started to happen. There are
        people who are now turning the warnings into action. Rich billionaires.
        You did not hear wrong. The owner of global capital, the richest people
        in the world. Multi billionaires. <br /><br />
        Some of these billionaires donate to environmental and climate research,
        while others try to make breakthroughs that help protect the Earth’s
        climate as much as their industry allows. <br /><br />
        But most interestingly, some billionaires, despairing of the future of
        the world, are looking for new Judi mountains where they can build new
        Noah’s ships and migrate. <br /><br />
        Actually, there is no need to leave Earth. Earth is a very large area.
        It has the potential to host all living things. No matter how large the
        populations are, if we can feed the poor instead of the rich, if we can
        prevent waste, if we can make the entire earth available for production,
        the Earth will become more livable for everyone. Moreover, this is much
        easier and cheaper than colonizing Mars or any other planet.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>SAVING</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        This is very important. We always think about production, but reducing
        consumption and especially saving is as important as production. For
        example, there is no difference between saving 100 watts of energy and
        producing 100 watts of energy. There is no difference between preventing
        the waste of 1 bread and producing 1 bread. If technology companies can
        prioritize savings as well as production, the loss of labor will be
        further reduced. Most importantly, we must control our waste and
        residues. Because these are the main causes of global climate change and
        hunger. <br /><br />
        First of all, we should start with keeping our house clean. Otherwise we
        won’t have a home. Jeff Bezos is so right. In particular, we can move
        factories that pollute our air to the Moon. I wish we had the power to
        do this. So we can stop the increasing pollution. Developed countries
        have moved polluting industrial establishments away from cities or even
        outside their own countries, and have significantly reduced air
        pollution. However, taking an astronaut to the ISS is $80 million even
        with current figures, while moving a factory or factories on Earth to
        the Moon does not seem practical for now. <br /><br />
        Elon Musk says “multiplanetary life can be a measure against what
        threatens the survival of the human race.” Jeff Bezos “If we want to, a
        trillion people can live in the solar system, then we can have thousands
        of Einsteins and Mozarts. What a great civilization that would be.” As
        it turns out, some billionaires see the solution in colonizeing space.
        They’re not wrong. No one is aware of or cares about the impending
        catastrophe. Protecting the human race in the event of a meteorite
        impact, global warming, nuclear war or an epidemic is crucial. That’s
        why billionaire businessmen like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson,
        Yuri Milner, Robert Bigelow … etc. are competing with each other to
        establish a colony in space. They have started from rocket research for
        now, but areas of specialization are emerging for all of them.
        <br /><br />
        Elon Musk wants to colonize Mars, Jeff Bezos wants to move industrial
        establishments to the moon, Robert Bigelow wants to build a tourism
        station in space with inflatable modules.

      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Of course, these are good deeds that turn into actions for the salvation
        of mankind. Promising advances from theory to practice. Don’t say
        impossible. Technology is advancing very fast. How far the invention of
        electricity has advanced human civilization. The unimaginable inventions
        of 100 years ago are now considered normal. How many people knew about a
        cell phone 30 years ago? Or human beings who started flying 120 years
        ago can go beyond the solar system after a century. We don’t know what
        the Earth and the scientific level will be like in a century, but what
        we call impossible may be perfectly normal in the future. <br /><br />
        Elon Musk. We can call it Christopher Columbus of the modern age.
        Christopher Columbus; it has expanded the horizons of mankind by opening
        up from the old world, which is no longer old and self-sufficient, to
        new worlds. If she hadn’t made the journeys that seemed difficult or
        impossible at the time, there would be no Hollywood, Maradona, or a NASA
        today. <br /><br />
        Like Christopher Columbus, Elon Musk is an idealistic explorer, far
        ahead of her time, who aimed to expand the boundaries of the world that
        is now consuming itself. Musk, who has spent his savings on the
        salvation of mankind thanks to the science he was curious about from an
        early age, and the extraordinary capital he has over time, is one of
        those who believes that the salvation of mankind is the colonization of
        other planets. He’s got everything he needs. Curiosity, imagination,
        knowledge and, most importantly, capital. Musk, one of the most beloved
        Americans in the world, believes that thanks to his popularity, he will
        achieve his goal.
      </p>

      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Jeff Bezos. Like Elon Musk, he’s a billionaire with plans way ahead of
        time. With the hotels and entertainment centers he intends to build in
        space, he designs alternative living spaces for people to Earth. While
        Bezos is making plans to establish a Las Vegas in space, he is a
        candidate to be the Moe Green of the modern age. These habitats would be
        emergency refuges in the event of a possible global catastrophe, let
        alone the crazy lovers who come for vacations, fun, honeymoons or even
        marriage proposals. <br /><br />
        Although we cannot call these billionaires scientists yet, their
        contributions to science are incredible. They spend astronomical sums of
        money to put ideas into action that no one has ever dreamed or dared to
        do. <br /><br />
        In fact, wherever you go, wherever you flee, you will definitely return
        to Earth, the only life-giving planet in the universe. Because you need
        this World. You can’t live anywhere else for long. Even with the most
        expensive and most advanced technology, if you colonize space, the
        climate of those colonies will be worse than the worst world climate.
        You need the air, water, food and climatic conditions of this Earth. All
        the vital substances you take with you will eventually run out.
        Recycling is useless. Because they will surely decrease or disappear as
        a result of an accident. The mill does not turn with transport water.
        <br /><br />
        Although our world has suffered many global catastrophes over time, it
        has surely managed to become optimal for life in the end. He suffered
        all kinds of disasters, from meteorite impact to ice age, but he still
        repaired himself. Mars, or any moon that is being considered colonized,
        has climate conditions worse than even the most severe nuclear disaster
        on Earth. <br /><br />
        Our world protects us like a parent. We have an atmosphere and a
        magnetic field. It is interesting that the planets and the Moon are in
        the most ideal orbits to protect our Earth from meteorites. But there’s
        no such vital feature in other places that might be available for life.
        Earth has survived disasters, but Mars, the moon, or any other planet
        has no such characteristics. A storm or a meteor disrupts the entire
        colony’s chain of vital necessities, and the colony is completely
        destroyed.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="img-scope">
        <img src="mars-surface.webp" alt="" />
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        You can’t go to any other star systems. Human beings can’t live long
        enough. While it takes thousands of years to get to even the nearest
        star, we can’t fit basic necessities such as air, food and drink into
        tiny spacecraft for hundreds of people on the long journey. And even if
        we go, can we find life? Even if we find it, what can we take with us?
        How can we build a civilization with the limited resources we have?
        <br /><br />
        How many people can we house on finite-resource planets that we can
        colonize? While people cannot live in peace and security even in the
        world, how can they live there without exploiting and killing each
        other? <br /><br />
        Wherever you colonize, there will be no places for happy people to live
        in rosy dreams. After all, those who will go to these places are the
        countries that massacred countries or continents or rich businessmen who
        are after more money. If they can’t make money from here, the colonies
        or people there have no value for businessmen. Every colonized place
        will one day be like Africa or America.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>AND DOOMSDAY BUNKERS</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        In a possible global disaster, safe zones are needed for the
        continuation of humankind and other living things. These structures,
        which have reached quite a number in the world for now, were in great
        demand. But this is not enough. We need to safely implant healthy
        embryos of healthy people with their DNA cleared to take with them to
        various parts of the universe. These can be safely stored in ingenious
        habitats such as Bigelow, which will be placed in low Earth orbit, or
        colonies to be built on other planets and moons, at least until the
        danger is over on Earth.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>DEVELOPMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Now I have prepared a conspiracy theory for you that could be the
        subject of a book or a great science fiction movie in Hollywood. To
        believe or not to believe is up to you. <br /><br />
        Have you ever thought? During the Cold War, when countries like the USA
        and the USSR were in a fierce space race, why did they suddenly quit
        this race? Just because the moon was set foot on it. In fact, the race
        could have continued after that. But they did not continue. Small
        flights were made in low Earth orbit for years. No further progress was
        made. <br /><br />
        And suddenly the world’s richest billionaires quit their main job and
        started the space race again. Do you think that the most professional
        actors of imperialism have suddenly devoted themselves to humanity?
        <br /><br />
        Look at world history. Capitalism has always existed and there is no
        pity for any living thing, especially human beings, in capitalism. Every
        way is permissible for capital. The ambition to win has no ethical
        limits. There is always the urge to win more. The worldly life is a
        paradise for the rich. That’s why they want to live for many years in
        order not to lose this paradise. <br /><br />
        Be careful. These days, the rich are always doing space studies. Why
        would anyone go to Mars when it is so expensive? Why would you live
        there? If you were rich enough to go there, would you go there, leaving
        Hawaii, Florida, Maldives, for example, when there are so many places to
        live in the world? Even the healthiest person cannot live in a healthy
        mood in a place no different from a prison. The road takes 7 months
        anyway. Even then, it destroys the psychology of the person. For
        example, there is no beautiful sky on Mars like here. You won’t be able
        to wake up with the sun on a spring morning and run like crazy to the
        countryside. In a dark place like a sunless, purple cloudy dawn, people
        become suicidal. <br /><br />
        There is a fact that few people realize yet. There is no life in the
        Universe other than Earth. It is impossible to settle for a long time by
        terraforming other planets or establishing a colony. Because both cost
        and supply, that is, continuity, cannot be ensured. It is now being
        investigated not to see if there are intelligent creatures other than us
        in space, but to see if there is a habitable planet other than this
        world. Scientists give up hope on aliens. We’re looking for a place
        where we can survive and take shelter, at least for a while.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>FOR A WHILE AND THEN ?</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Then we will come from the earth and return to the earth. To where we
        were born. You know, we said that wherever we go, we still need the
        world. Yeah. We cannot live anywhere else without the world. We have to
        return to the world. But you can say the Earth has become uninhabitable.
        Let it be. It will go back to its good old days as before. Look at
        Hiroshima. How long did it take for the city to return to normal?
        <br /><br />
        Millions of people died in the great plague epidemic of the Middle Ages.
        Europe lost 60% of its population. Following this, with the decreasing
        population, the world quickly recovered itself. This situation became
        one of the most important reasons for the development of Europe with the
        Renaissance. Look at the recent developed world states. All of these
        countries entered World War II and lost millions of their people. It
        seems that the decreasing population increases the welfare level in
        societies. <br /><br />
        Being aware of this, global capital owners are thinking of getting rid
        of the disasters on Earth by escaping into space. At least until the
        climate and human population return to reasonable levels.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>SO WHY SPACE COLONIES INSTEAD OF THE EARTH BUNKERS ?</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        The rich think it makes more sense to leave Earth than to protect
        Earth’s bunkers from angry mobs. They cannot even protect themselves
        from the guardians who will protect them because in an apocalyptic
        global catastrophe no one, including the guardians, can be kept in
        check. These guards also have families. You will say, what if there is a
        security team from those who have no family? What if these familyless
        security guards were left with no choice but absolute obedience? With
        the mass extinction of billions in front of the eyes of the people, no
        one can be disciplined. But in non-populated space colonies, the
        security problem will also disappear. <br /><br />
        Now let’s get to the most important issue.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>ARTIFICIAL SELECTION</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        What if this global extinction was planned? What if the human population
        on Earth were again reduced to a controllable number by capable humans?
        <br /><br />
        Have you ever thought? How have people been helpless during the time of
        Covid19? Why did some capital owners like Musk, Bezos or Gates become
        even richer while the world economy suffered greatly during the
        epidemic? <br /><br />
        While Elon Musk is in the IT industry, why is she establishing companies
        for colonizing Mars, renewable energy sources such as electric vehicles,
        and broadcasting internet from space to the whole world? Why is Jeff
        Bezos focusing on space settlement when he’s doing internet business?
        Why did Bill Gates become interested in the vaccine and chip industry,
        which has nothing to do with software, when he was running a software
        company? Why is he buying an excessive amount of land from all over the
        world. Why are so many billionaires suddenly tempted to travel to space?
        <br /><br />
        Let’s think about it using our imagination. Why? <br /><br />
        Now you will say that you did too. Because they are looking for a
        shelter for humanity in the coming climate change and a global disaster.
        <br /><br />
        So when will these disasters happen? It will happen if action is not
        taken. Maybe neither billionaires nor our lifetime will be able to see
        it. <br /><br />
        But this time, you will say, why should billionaires make investments
        that do not benefit them? No. All their investments are for elite
        capital owners. <br /><br />
        As seen in Covid19, a biological attack significantly reduces the human
        population all over the world.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="img-scope">

      <div class="img-desc"><p>Life After People</p></div>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        A nuclear and chemical attack on a global scale may get out of control
        and the earth may not be suitable for life for many years. But the
        effect of a biological attack can be brought under control in a short
        time with vaccines and drugs. Even the great plague epidemic, which
        killed about 200 million people in the Middle Ages, was over within 4
        years. <br /><br />
        Just as claimed in covid19, the human population can be safely inhabited
        in colonies in space until the human population reaches a controllable
        number through a controlled biological attack by fabrication. Since the
        effect of the epidemic is short-lived, vital necessities are not a
        problem. <br /><br />
        When the epidemic is brought back under control, the “ELITE” living in
        the heavens will safely return to Earth.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>AND THEN?</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        As the factors polluting the environment will decrease with the
        decreasing population, the climate starts to get back into order.
        <br /><br />
        In the emerging New World Order, there will be only one state without
        borders, one law, one nation, one religion, one language, one valid
        currency. Capital owner ‘elite’. “The chosen ones” such as doctors,
        engineers, teachers, etc. necessary for the society. And “workers”.
        According to this caste system, small colonies that are easy to control
        are established. <br /><br />
        Yeah. Thus, the Earth’s climate was saved, and human beings were reduced
        to the required number. Since the population is under control, different
        ideologies do not cause conflict, and with a high level of prosperity,
        people continue the lineage of human beings in peace in the Matrix and
        Metaverse world, where they think they are happy.

      <h2>EXODUS PROJECT</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        The project of the millennium. But it’s also that simple. <br /><br />
        Said billionaires are trying to build ships to save the chosen ones from
        petty apocalypse when the Day of Exodus arrives. When the time comes,
        the elite and the chosen will board these ships and settle in the space
        colonies prepared for them. <br /><br />
        What will happen to the billions left in the world? Artificial
        selection. Just like in the covid19 plandemic exercise, the human
        population will be reduced to a reasonable level with a controlled
        biological attack. Do not ask what is the reasonable level, because with
        a little research it can be easily found which people pronounce which
        numbers.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>AND THEN?</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        After the population drops to the desired levels, the elites from the
        skies will now be able to easily rule the Earth as they wish. Who are
        these elites? Of course, like the divine being who ordered the prophet
        Noah to build an ark, they are the masters of wisdom who now declare
        themselves divine beings from the heavens and order billionaires to
        build spaceships. <br /><br />
        These intelligent elites will watch over the world, they will control
        human beings as they wish and declare their so-called divinity with the
        laws they set, with chips, fake worlds such as the Matrix and Metaverse.
        <br /><br />
        Now, can you better understand what Starlink, Neuralink, Metaverse,
        Bitcoin, brain chip implantation, vaccine research, rocket trials and
        space colonies are for? The horizons of those who know what these words
        are, are getting wider. If you put the pieces in place, you will see the
        main picture of the puzzle very clearly. <br /><br />
        Pay attention to this, both in the present and in the near future.
        Scientific and technological studies will always develop in line with
        enabling this project.

        O mankind. Protect yourself. If you don’t have billions of dollars or a
        very distinguished family, you don’t have a ticket to those ships. If
        you want to find a place for yourself in the New World Order, build
        shelters where you can stay safely for at least three to five years.
        Time is running out. The Covid19 plandemic was a exercise and
        demonstrated what could happen. <br /><br />
        Contrary to what is known, the salvation of the world is not science but
        staying away from science. Didn’t science make the world this way
        anyway? For thousands of years, people have lived away from science and
        technology, without problems such as environmental pollution or global
        warming. So it is possible to live without science. <br /><br />
        Although science is arrogant and in conflict with religion and politics,
        it is chiefly responsible for climate change and pollution on the
        planet. From satellites in Earth orbit and space junk, nuclear or
        thermal power plants, factory chimneys, mines are all the work of
        pollution and destruction caused by science. It would be too optimistic
        to expect the polluters to save the world, especially the rich. Of
        course, the scientists found the culprit and immediately decided on his
        sentence. Execution. Yeah. Don’t be surprised. They explained that one
        of the biggest causes of global warming due to carbon emissions in the
        world is cattle. And they claimed to meet the meat needs of people with
        fake meat produced from plants by killing animals.

      <h2>WHAT ABOUT SPACE ?</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Especially low Earth orbit, unfortunately, has already turned into space
        junk. It is very difficult to clean and is becoming more and more a
        problem day by day. These garbage can enter the atmosphere from time to
        time and cause UFO hallucinations in radar and thermal cameras. Of
        course, this does not bother many people because astronomical resources
        are allocated to NASA or the like for many inconclusive projects like
        SETI. <br /><br />
        New World Order. In these first years of the millennium, players are
        slowly taking their places for the plans for the next millennium.
        Although the plans spread over many years, it is the most important
        issue for human beings to know why they came to this world in their
        short life in parametric uncertainty and why they died when the time
        came and fulfill their duty. All people are born, live and die. Why? If
        you can find the reason, that is the main purpose and the straight path.
        <br /><br />
        Don’t let man-made artificial worlds keep you on your way…
