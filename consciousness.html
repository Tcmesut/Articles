      <h2>DOES CONSCIOUSNESS EXIST ONLY IN HUMANS ?</h2>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Or is it a phenomenon of living beings such as animals and plants? Do
        non-living things have consciousness? <br /><br />
        Even from the very first moments of the big bang, all atoms, particles,
        dust and gases began to act according to the laws of physics that are
        still valid for a certain task. The consciousness found in these
        substances is the same as the consciousness that still continues today.
        It never evolved. Was it formed by a white hole-like event from another
        universe whose physical laws are the same as ours? Or was there a
        miniature universe that was taught its duties when the time came,
        awaiting its turn, ready to work? <br /><br />
        Why do vitamins from food go where they need to be? Why do electrons
        always spin in the same place? Why is the water flowing down the slope?
        Because all living and non-living beings, from the smallest particle at
        the quantum level to the largest cosmological structure in the universal
        dimension, have a consciousness. <br /><br />
        Man has consciousness. But our human arm also has a consciousness, and
        the fingers of this arm, the veins in the fingers, the blood in the
        veins, the red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in the
        bloodâ€¦.etc. There is a separate consciousness in all of them, from the
        atoms and even the particles in the blood. <br /><br />
        So, how did this consciousness, which is present in all parts of
        existence of all sizes, all of a sudden, come into being?
