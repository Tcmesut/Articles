                    WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR ? Rather than finding intelligent
                    creatures, we are looking for planets that are conducive to
                    colonization. The worst climatic conditions on Earth are
                    even better than the planets we think are best suited for
                    the colony. Establishing colonies on other planets is of
                    course imperative. But I wish we could use the limited
                    capital and financial resources we have to make our world
                    more livable.

                    the Children of Israel, which tells the story of their
                    return to their promised land centuries ago under the
                    leadership of the prophet Moses because of the famine caused
                    by the climatic conditions.

                    universe? This question is one of the most curious questions
                    of mankind throughout history. Especially in the last
                    century, with the increasing scientific developments, more
                    intensive researches have started to search for the answer
                    to this question. Billions of dollars are being made to find
                    this answer, and these investments seem to continue in the
                    future.

                    will get to know him more closely.

                  <p>
                    Artificial intelligence. Today, due to the global pandemic,
                    countries have lost billions, even trillions of dollars in
                    income. The industrial establishments suffered the most in
                    this. If robotization or mechanization were at a high level,
                    they would not be so affected by the damage. In the
                    pandemic, when we look at companies, it was seen that the
                    more robotization there is, the less income loss. Of course
                    also in production.

                    NEW EYES OF HUMANITY The James Webb Telescope has finally
                    been launched. A giant step for humanity. It is certain that
                    we will see much farther and much higher quality images in
                    the universe than Hubble. It is not known what discoveries
                    will be made. But in a universe where the nearest and
                    farthest stars are not different from each other, it is very
                    difficult to think that the end of the universe will be
                    seen, extraterrestrial life forms and intelligent creatures
                    will be discovered.
