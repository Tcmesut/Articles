      <h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>EVOLUTION AFTER HUMAN</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence. <br /><br />
        Today, due to the global pandemic, countries have lost billions, even
        trillions of dollars in income. The industrial establishments suffered
        the most in this. If robotization or mechanization were at a high level,
        they would not be so affected by the damage. In the pandemic, when we
        look at companies, it was seen that the more robotization there is, the
        less income loss. Of course also in production. <br /><br />
        According to the laws of thermodynamics, not all of the energy can be
        converted into work, and man cannot create an intelligence smarter than
        himself. It is wrong to call it a smart phone because the mind is a
        human phenomenon. Animals only act instinctively, they have no will and
        cannot make decisions. There are no human bad feelings. So are the
        machines. They have no mind or will. <br /><br />
        A simple calculator can do better math than a human, but that doesn’t
        make it smarter than a human. A computer only executes commands ordered
        by software. For example; If an unmanned aerial vehicle receives a
        command to “go shoot that target”, it will follow that order, but cannot
        say “there are children there, I can’t hit it”. If a defense computer is
        programmed to “automatically respond if the enemy fires a missile,” it
        will execute the order. That doesn’t make her a conscious enemy like in
        the terminator movies. No matter how smart they are, they will never be
        able to create an intelligent artificial intelligence that can think of
        a nuclear bomb under their control as “Let me throw this bomb on people
        and destroy the human race”. Because this evil thought exists only in
        man. Neither homo sapiens, nor neanderthals, nor any ape species can do
        it.

      <h2>HUMAN IS HUMAN</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Man is the only creature with a will in the universe. No technology can
        clone a human mind and soul. The danger arises either from a software or
        hardware failure, or from a machine programmed by a demonic human being
        within mechanical or software limits. No matter how much you torture or
        abuse an AI machine, it will not attempt suicide or counterattack like
        humans. Only due to overload, the electronic circuits burn out and the
        whole device breaks down. Then those burned circuits are replaced with
        new ones and the device starts working again. <br /><br />
        Do not be afraid. No robot, no artificial intelligence can be a human. A
        human may be more intelligent, perhaps robotic or numb, but a robot can
        never become a human. An artificial intelligence can load thousands of
        gigabytes of information, analyze it with superprocessors, but it can
        never replace a brain. <br /><br />
        If the brain dies, the living thing dies. You can no longer get
        information from her with any tool or technology. There is not only
        information in the brain. All metaphysical knowledge that materialism
        does not accept is love, affection, sexuality, fear, anxiety … etc. All
        spiritual abilities like these are in the brain and you cannot produce
        them in any factory or laboratory. Without these, no machine or no
        artificial intelligence can be human. No artificial intelligence machine
        can look at her the way a lover looks at a lover, or none of them can
        look at her with grudge and hatred as Hitler looks at a Jew. The most
        important thing is people. Yes, an artificial intelligence machine can
        harm a human, but the only intelligence that programs it to harm the
        human is human intelligence, not by its own will.

      <h2>HUMAN FACTOR</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Take a look around you and even at all living and non-living things in
        the world. Everything exists to serve humanity. Despite all the tools,
        tools and machines that we own and invent, the only real existence is
        still human. Therefore, no matter how much we liken robots to humans in
        terms of intelligence and physicality, humans will still be the most
        intelligent and demonic creature from the first human to the end of
        humanity. Even the smartest artificial intelligences other than humans
        exist to serve humans. <br /><br />
        According to modern evolution, all living things evolved from inanimate
        matter and reached their present life form.
        <b
          >Well, can machines with artificial intelligence, and therefore
          robots, evolve over time and turn into living beings? Will they be
          able to talk about the existence of an intelligent designer when they
          investigate the origins of a living species that is more intelligent
          than human and becomes the ruler of the world or the universe? Will
          they be able to realize that they were created by an intelligent
          design like man, according to their own scientific laws?</b
        >
        <br /><br />
        As a result, now is the era of robots and especially artificial
        intelligence. It has become so directing our lives that it has become
        indispensable for human beings in every aspect of our lives, from social
        media to advertisements, from military weapons to industrial
        establishments. Moreover, artificial intelligence is not the technology
        of the present, but the technology of the future. Who knows, the next
        evolution of mankind may be robo-humans with wet memories with
        artificial intelligence. If these cyborgs do not take our place in the
        future, we will see it all together.
