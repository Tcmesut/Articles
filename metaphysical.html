      <br /><br />
      <h2>WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR ?</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Rather than finding intelligent creatures, we are looking for planets
        that are conducive to colonization. The worst climatic conditions on
        Earth are even better than the planets we think are best suited for the
        colony. Establishing colonies on other planets is of course imperative.
        But I wish we could use the limited capital and financial resources we
        have to make our world more livable. <br /><br />
        With the probes we send to many planets, satellites or celestial bodies,
        we search for water or organic matter on those planets. So, would
        finding water be evidence of life on that planet or that living things
        once lived? If life began on the planet Thea, which is thought to be in
        the same temperate zone as on Earth before the collision with Thea,
        there may be fossil remains in meteorites that spread after the
        collision and fell on nearby celestial bodies. It could be water that
        came with meteorites and evaporated after freezing there. Technically,
        water may have once been found on Mars or the Moon, due to water coming
        from meteorites. However, if the solar wind made the planet
        uninhabitable 3.9 billion years ago on Mars, which was formed on average
        4.5 billion years ago, then life could not develop sufficiently during
        this period, or it could not find time to form at all. Even underground,
        it is very difficult to create life in such a narrow space and under
        adverse conditions. <br /><br />
        The history of mankind is estimated at 7 thousand to 140 thousand years.
        In this process, we were able to comprehend the laws of thermodynamics.
        Then we imagined something radical like warp driving. This technological
        process took place in the last century of 140,000 years. What if
        creatures smarter than us went far beyond us and discovered an even more
        radical technology? Think. What would our technology be like if
        electricity had not been discovered?
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>I AM WRITING AGAIN</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        When looking for extraterrestrials, don’t think only in terms of the
        physical characteristics of our world. The surface of our earth and 70%
        of our body consists of water. Why should life on other planets be in
        this proportion? Different creatures may live in different physical
        structures in different celestial bodies. There may even be creatures
        that cannot move, just like plants. Since there may be creatures with
        camouflage abilities like Corydalis Hemidicentra, we may not be able to
        see them.

      <p>
        If we can’t see it, we can’t say it doesn’t exist. It’s different to
        look at it and see it. Even not seeing and not being able to see are
        different things. If we can find ways to see what we don’t see while
        looking for what we hope for, then we can find the answers we seek. We
        can’t see black holes either, but we don’t ignore them. We can detect
        its presence in indirect ways. We cannot see infrared and ultraviolet
        rays or thermal images with our 5 senses, but we do not ignore them.
        That’s why we have to look at the universe in different ways.
        <br /><br />
        According to one analysis, if there was only life on earth despite the
        enormous size of the universe, there would be a huge loss of space in
        that universe. The masses of the stars in the universe occupy large
        areas in the universe. The absence of any living forms here would also
        cause a huge loss of space. Moreover, looking at the amount of universal
        heat, for example, there is only a 400 degree difference in the world’s
        vitality in the temperature range from -276 degrees to millions of
        degrees, and since standard life is not seen at more than 120 degrees,
        life in the world is considered to have a cold climate. This universal
        temperature difference means a huge loss of space. We have to take into
        account that there may be life in areas warmer than 120 degrees, and
        that there may be life forms made of light or photons. However radical
        this proposition may be, it is theoretically possible. <br /><br />
        As I wrote above and in my previous article, we are no longer looking
        for other intelligent creatures in space. Because we have given up hope.
        Even the light of the fire lit by the first man on earth has not yet
        come out of the Milky Way. The closest galaxy to our galaxy is 2.5
        million light years away, and there are between 2 and 10 trillion
        galaxies in the universe. If we don’t come up with radical ideas like
        fantastic warp drive, the intelligent creatures we can detect are of no
        use to us. For example, if we discovered Darth Wader 2 billion light
        years away, what would her galactic empire be to us?

      <h2>SCIENTISTS NEED TO BE ASKED THESE QUESTIONS.</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        What do you understand by the term extraterrestrial intelligent beings?
        <br /><br />
        Have you communicated with metaphysical beings? You may not believe it
        because you have not communicated. So if you can communicate, can you
        believe in its existence? If you have communicated with metaphysical
        beings, is their existence proven? <br /><br />
        Can you spot the difference between the unidentified light you see on a
        tomb and the unidentified light you see through the ISS window?
        <br /><br />
        In monotheistic religions, these beings can travel long distances in a
        short time as they are created from light. They can learn about events
        in the past throughout their long lives. Thanks to these features, can
        we have information about our past or distant universes that human
        beings can never reach? <br /><br />
        E = mc2. Here is the equation of the universe. Energy turns into matter,
        and matter turns into energy. But it never disappears. Human. It comes
        to the material universe when it is in energy form and turns into energy
        again with death. But it never disappears. Now we’re going to ignore
        death, soul and self? Which of the known energy can we see? What about
        dark energy? What about dark matter? But we say they exist. We say it
        exists theoretically because we cannot prove it with any physical
        evidence. But materialist scientists claim it exists. Not scientifically
        because it cannot be felt with the 5 senses. Only in theory.
        <br /><br />
        God explained his existence to the people through scriptures and
        prophets, and those who knew how to think accepted the existence of God.
        Materialist scientists, on the other hand, found it unscientific. But
        they believed in the idea of an unscient alien with no signs of life, no
        trace, perhaps even none. Instead of books from God, they found Plato’s
        books, for example, scientific. This situation reveals how science is
        insufficient to reach the truth and how far-reaching and superior
        knowledge is to science.

      <h2>
        THERE ARE 2 SIMILATITIES BETWEEN MONOTHEISTIC RELIGIONS AND EVOLUTIONIST
        BOOKS
      </h2> <br><br>
      <p><ul><li>According to modern evolution, the first living things were formed from inorganic materials. According to the monotheistic religions, living things, especially the first man, were created from mud, that is, from inorganic materials.</li></ul></p><br><br>
       <p> But the only difference between a mud pile and a human being is the soul. If we can understand the soul, dissolve it, make that person an artificial soul and combine it with an inanimate matter, then we can create a human from any soil or mud we want. If the soul is an energy, we can achieve this if we can control it and direct it to other inanimate beings. <br><br>
        Let’s consider the most extreme evolutionary coincidences. For example, atoms acted by chance and formed an organic matter, and these organic substances combined to form a plant, animal or human being. Well, what good is it when there is no spirit that can move these creatures? Consider a robot. No matter how human-like this robot may be. Even create an exact human with a 3D printer. Without a soul, it cannot be as alive as even the simplest microorganism. The most important feature that distinguishes a robot or statue from a living thing is the spirit. How did the soul, which is the most important necessity for all living things, come about? The soul, which cannot be felt with the 5 senses and has no atomic and mass basis, is more important than all other necessities. <br><br>
        Could future super-quantum computers and software replace the soul? If we could completely decipher and replicate human intelligence, could we create a soul? Or, with neuralink or the like, can we move a robot, or any vehicle, or a dead person, just as if they had a soul?
    </p> <br><br>
    <h2>AN ALIEN ON EARTH: HUMAN </h2> <br><br>
    <p><ul><li>According to scientific theories, life on earth came from Mars or another unknown planet via meteorites. In monotheistic religions, man came from heaven.</li></ul></p>
    <br><br>
<p> According to some scientists, life on earth came from outer space. This is debatable. Just an assumption. But according to the concept of creativity, man does not belong to the world. Because it came from an extraterrestrial place we don’t know where it is, called heaven. <br><br>

     <p> The universe is so vast and enormous for man that he sees himself as small and helpless. The universe seems infinite to us and so big that we will never reach its limit. But this is how Allah created the universe. O my servants. Here is my clever design, my seemingly endless universe. If you can transcend the limits of the heavens and the earth, then go away. But Allah says you cannot pass unless there is a power given by us. How can we cross those borders? The closest star is 4.2 light years away. If we try to go with the fastest spacecraft, it takes 80,000 years. There are 400 billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy. There are around 10 trillion galaxies in the observable universe. Well, let’s cross the limits. But even that universe is finite because only the power of its creator is infinite. O mankind. No matter how small you are in the size of the universe, you are the most valuable being in that universe. <br><br>
      There are two fundamental truths about this world. Birth and death. Every living thing is born and dies. We do not know how long we will live, but we know that we will surely die. This is certain. Call it scientific law or religious belief. Every living thing is born and due to parametric uncertainty, it will die in a time period within that parameter range. Things that happen all the time cannot be coincidence. This birth and death must have a reason, a purpose. If we know the purpose, the rest is details.
